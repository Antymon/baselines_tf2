Baselines TF2.0
==========
Selected Deep RL algorithms using Tensorflow 2.0's Autograph and `tf.function` which are described as a merger of 
a priori computational graph definition and eager execution. Algorithms were largely ported from Stable Baselines @Hill2018 Deep Reinforcement Learning suite (with some utils brought over).
At the moment SAC @Haarnoja2018 and DDPG @Silver2014 are available.

Prerequisites
--------
Tensorflow 2.0 is needed. As of November 2019 this is a default version when pulled through **latest** `pip`.

Examples
--------
There are 2 tested SAC hyperparameter configurations in a form of `run_sac_*.py` under the root directory. 
Those are: a) simple Continuous Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym framework @Brockman2016, 
b) more complicated 18-DOF Hexapod robot setup through DART simulation engine @Lee2018. Hexapod robot @Cully2015 is tasked to walk as far as possible along X-axis ([example recording](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ds_VrjTDdhqWkh40eF1vscetfUyJUlVm)).


1) To set up Lunar Lander the OpenAI's Gym with Box2D is needed (can be found at respective pages, helper script for the latter under Linux is provided). Solved environment yields reward of 200 and above.

2) Setup of a Hexapod is more involved - I can publish a Docker Linux container at a request (based on repositories mentioned below). Generally a reward of under 2 signifies hexapod properly walking. TensorBoard charts obtained from the example show that SAC can reach that state in just 2M frames (and hyper parameters were not tuned at all):

State of the project
--------
This a quick proof-of-concept set up for educational purposes. SAC should be easy to follow although generally codebase is not High Valyrian. Let me know if this project is useful for you!
